# Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) Macro Language (M²L)
M²L, an abbreviation of Musical Instrument Digital Interface Macro Language or MIDI Macro Language, is a macro-based, compiled programming language for MIDI. Pronounced "M-squared-L", "M-two-L" or "M-T-L". Written in ANSI C, it is designed to be cross-platform and **should** be compatible with most versions of **Windows**, **\*nix**, and **DOS\***. 
\*DOS users may have to convert files downloaded from GitHub to use CP437/ANSI encodings with CRLF line endings, as DOS does not support UTF-8.
